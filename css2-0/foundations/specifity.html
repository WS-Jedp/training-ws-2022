                All the lines of CSS have their own weight so the heavier is the instruction, it will be more important to apply those styles into the elements selected. <br>
                To compute the weight of a CSS declaration it is with their selectors, the more specific it is the selector the more weight it will have. So if we select .header #nav it will be more important than #nav 
            </p>
            <div class="emmet-example">
                .header #nav {
                    ... This is heavier
                }

                #nav {
                    ... This is ligther
                }
            </div>

            <p class="emmet-explanation">
                If there is more than two declarations with the same weight, CSS will pick the last one in our CSS document.
            </p>
            <p class="emmet-explanation">
                It is important to know that the ID is heavier than the class selector, and the class selector is heavier than the tag selector.
